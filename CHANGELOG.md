# 0.4.0-rust-1.45.2

- **Breaking change** in avoid mixed user permissions when volume mounting cargo cache directories. This docker images now configures a cargo installation to `/cargo` directory rather than `/home/root/.cargo`. You'll also want to ensure
  docker runs use a docker user that maps to your host machine's user id and group.

```diff
$ docker run --rm \
+    -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -v ${PWD}:/code \
+    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/registry:/cargo/registry \
+    -v ${HOME}/.cargo/git:/cargo/git \

# 0.3.0-rust-1.44.1

- Put unzipped `boostrap` and `bootstrap.debug` files under `target/lambda/${PROFILE}/output/${BIN}` dir
  to allow for using these artifacts without an intermediate `.zip` file creation step.
- Introduce `$PACKAGE` env var. Setting `-e PACKAGE=false` prevents `.zip` archive from
  being created and `package` hook from running.

# 0.2.6-rust-1.38.0

- Debug info in `release` profiles is now only included when a `DEBUGINFO` env variable is provided. This perserves previous behavior and makes enabling this an opt-in feature for `release` binaries

# 0.2.5-rust-1.38.0

- reduced total size of docker image by **~277MB** leveraging new [rustup `minimal` profile](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/10/15/Rustup-1.20.0.html)

# 0.2.4-rust-1.38.0

- Fixed regression from previous release cargo workspaces we failing to resolve binary names
- `dev` profile builds are no longer run though `strip` which increases their binary size but retain their debug information
- `release` profile builds (the default) still have debug information stripped but produce a file named `{your-binary-name}.debug` which final release binary contains a debug link to.
